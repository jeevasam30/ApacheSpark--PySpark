# Movie Recommendation using Spark

This repository contains two Python scripts that implement a movie recommendation system using the Apache Spark framework.

## Movie Similarities

### Description

The `similar_movies.py` script calculates movie similarities based on user ratings. It uses the Cosine Similarity algorithm to find movies that are similar to a given movie. The results are then filtered based on specified thresholds.

### Usage

1. Make sure you have Apache Spark installed.
2. Run the script using Python:


python similar_movies.py [movieID]
Replace [movieID] with the ID of the movie you want to find similarities for.

Movie Recommendations
Description
The `movie_recommendation.py`   script uses the ALS (Alternating Least Squares) algorithm to provide personalized movie recommendations for a given user.

Usage
Make sure you have Apache Spark installed.
Run the script using Python:

python movie_recommendation.py [userID]
Replace [userID] with the ID of the user you want to generate recommendations for.

Dataset
Both scripts use the MovieLens dataset. You can find more information about the dataset here.

Note
Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions and access to the dataset files.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance with these scripts. Happy movie recommending!
